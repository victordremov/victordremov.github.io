    How mailing variants should be distributed between recipients? We compare strategies:
    <ul>
      <li>Send defined number of emails with random variants.
      Choose best mailing variant and use it for rest recipients.</li>
      <li>Send defined number of emails with random variants.
      Apply statistical n-sampled test.
      If there is significantly better mailing variant, use it for rest recipients.
      If there is not, continue to send randomly.</li>
      <li>Use feedback to send better variants more ofter and worse variants less ofter.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
 <li>Represent results as website where user can run tests and compare which is good for his business.</li>
</ul>
